### Common inputs:
#### Bearing design problems: 
C10 = load rating, 

Fr = Force on bearing, 

a = bearing constant, 

Timken = y/n question, 

L = lifespan.
#### Key design problems: 
Sy = yield strength, 

t = thickness, 

l = depth,

T = torque, 

d = diameter, 

r = radius, 

n = safety factor. 

### Common outputs:
#### Bearing design problems:
Lifespan = L

Load Rating = C10
#### Key design problems:
n given key = n 

key given n

    depth = l <-- That's l as in larry

    cross section = t/d 

    shear strength = Sy
